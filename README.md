/* This file includes instructions for running the code */

The Code struture is as follows:

1. cars.m (MATLAB code for video processing)
2. server.py (python code for running the server)
3. Traffic2 (a folder with all android files)


Instructions to run the server:

1. Run the file server.py on a python IDE or an a linux terminal using the command 'python server.py'
